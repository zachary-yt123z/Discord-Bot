# Python Discord Bot

## How to start

To start the bot you simply need to launch, either your terminal (Linux, Mac & Windows), or your Command Prompt (
Windows)
.

Before running the bot you will need to install all the requirements with this command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you have multiple versions of python installed (2.x and 3.x) then you will need to use the following command:

```
python3 bot.py
```

or eventually

```
python3.x bot.py
```
Replace `x` with the version of Python you have installed.

If you have just installed python today, then you just need to use the following command:

```
python bot.py
```
